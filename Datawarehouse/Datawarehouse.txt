Data Warehouse
Setup
Use your existing PostgreSQL database access method.

OLTP (Online Transational Processing)
The following files contain a backup of a transactional database system: init.sql, trans.sql.
Restore them into your database, using a separate schema is strongly recommended to avoid name clash with existing tables.
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
Design an OLAP star model based on the given OLTP system. Create at least 3 dimensions.
Implement OLAP as a relational database in a new schema, e.g. olap; when working with schemas, remember about setting the search_path variable, e.g.:

SET search_path TO olap, public;
Implement ETL with SQL loading your OLAP model with data from the OLTP tables. Use INSERT INTO ... SELECT.
Write an SQL query on the OLAP model which provides aggregated values for each month for a selected year. Pick the value depending on what your fact table looks like.
