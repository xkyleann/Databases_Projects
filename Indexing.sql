-- P2_Indexing 
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Topic: Indexing, the goal of this lab working with advanced indeing in relational databases. 
-- In florist's shop there are two database. 1-ascii.sql and other one is 3-ascii.sql
-- orders --> all_orders

\o exercise1.txt -- Execute a query which displays all orders for the buk1 composition. Check the execution plan and take note of the execution times.
SELECT * FROM all_orders WHERE compositions_no = 'buk1'; -- compositions_no also refers composition_id

\o exercise2.txt -- Delete the index created in the previous exercise and create a similar one, but using B-trees. Repeat the previous query and take a note of the results.
CREATE INDEX compositions_in ON all_orders (compositions_no);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT DESCRIPTION * FROM WHERE compositions_no = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM WHERE compositions_no < 'c' -- Execute a query displaying orders of all compositions with IDs beginning with letters appearing before the letter 'c' in the alphabet. Is the index in use?

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM all_orders WHERE compositions_no ~ '^c'; -- can be removed 
DROP INDEX compositions_in;

\o exercise3.txt -- Create an index for the remarks column and query the database for all orders with remarks beginning with the "do" string. Is the index in use?

\o exercise7.txt -- Create an index and write a query which retrieves clients living in a city which begins with a given string (e.g. "krak"), regardless of the case (e.g. "krak"="Krak"="KRAK", etc.).

\o exercise8.txt -- Add a column called location of type point to the orders table. Populate this column with random data within the (0,0)â€“(100,100) range:
ALTER  TABLE orders ADD  COLUMN location point;
UPDATE all_orders SET location = point ( random ( ) * 100 , random ( ) * 100 ) ;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM all_orders ORDER BY location <-> point '(50,50)' LIMIT 10;
