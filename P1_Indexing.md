# DATABASES P1
- Project topic is **_Indexing_** 
- Documantation can be find at --> [Lecture 1](https://github.com/Kyleann/AGH_Databeses_2/files/11012274/01-recap-sql-postgres-latest.pdf)

## Useful SQL Commands 
  - The **ANALYZE** command collects statistics of value distribution in table columns and stores them in the pg_statistic system catalog. The planner will only be able to determine an optimal execution plan if the ANALYZE command was executed for a given table and its columns significant for the query.
  - The **EXPLAIN** command displays the query execution plan. Using the **_VERBOSE_** option will show more details. The **_ANALYZE_** option automatically executes **_ANALYZE_** and the query itself, letting EXPLAIN display not only the plan but also the actual execution results.
  
## Projects 
- Exercise for Indexing with SQL. 
- Includes 8 exercises including answers.
##### Task 1: Hash-Based Indexes 
- Execute a query that displays all orders for the buk1 composition. Check the execution plan and take note of the execution times.
- Add a hash-based index that can accelerate the aforementioned query to the orders table. Take note of the plan and execution plan.
- **_Solution_** for **_Task 1_**, should be like this: 
```SQL
exercise1.txt -- Execute a query that displays all orders for the buk1 composition. Check the execution plan and take note of the execution times.
SELECT * FROM all_orders WHERE compositions_no = 'buk1'; -- compositions_no also refers composition_id
CREATE INDEX compositions_in ON orders USING hash (compositions_no);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT DESCRIPTION * FROM all_orders WHERE composition_no = 'buk1';
```
##### Task 2: B-tree indexes
- Delete the index created in the previous exercise and create a similar one, but using B-trees. Repeat the previous query and take a note of the results.
- Execute a query displaying orders of all compositions with IDs beginning with letters appearing before the letter 'c' in the alphabet. Is the index in use?
- Run another query, displaying the remaining orders (beginning with 'c' and so on). Is the index in use now?
- Try forcing the use of indexes by switching the enable_seqscan parameter:
```SQL
SET ENABLE_SEQSCAN TO OFF;
```
- This will "encourage" PostgreSQL to use indexes â€“ this kind of optimisation may be useful when using mass storage with short seek times, such as SSD drives. Repeat the two queries and compare their execution plans and times.
- **_Solution_** for **_Task 2_**, should be like this: 
```SQL
exercise2.txt -- Delete the index created in the previous exercise and create a similar one, but using B-trees. Repeat the previous query and take a note of the results.
CREATE INDEX compositions_in ON all_orders (compositions_no);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT DESCRIPTION * FROM WHERE compositions_no = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM WHERE compositions_no < 'c' -- Execute a query displaying orders of all compositions with IDs beginning with letters appearing before the letter 'c' in the alphabet. Is the index in use?
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT compositions_no from all_orders where compositions_no ='c' AND paid='f';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM all_orders WHERE compositions_no ~ '^c'; -- can be removed 
DROP INDEX compositions_in;
```
##### Task 3: Indexes and pattern matching
- Create an index for the remarks column and query the database for all orders with remarks beginning with the "do" string. Is the index in use?
- Delete the index and create a new one, but this time explicitly set its operator class (varchar_pattern_ops):
```SQL
CREATE INDEX orders_remarks_idx ON orders (remarks varchar_pattern_ops);
```
- Repeat the exercise and compare the results.
- **_Solution_** for **_Task 3_**, should be like this: 
```SQL
exercise3.txt -- Create an index for the remarks column and query the database for all orders with remarks beginning with the "do" string. Is the index in use?
CREATE INDEX orders_remarks ON orders (remarks);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SElECT * FROM orders WHERE remarks LIKE 'do%';
DROP INDEX orders_remarks;
CREATE INDEX orders_remarks_idx ON orders (remarks varchar_pattern_ops);
DROP INDEX orders_remarks;
```
##### Task 4:  Multi-column indexes
- Create a multi-column index covering the **_client_id, recipient_id and composition_id_** columns.
- Choose one value existing in these columns and run:
  - a query which joins the constraints for the three columns using the           **_AND_** operator,
  - a similar query, but using **_OR_**
- Compare the execution plans. 
- Now query the database for all orders of the **_buk1_** composition.
- Remove the index and create separate indexes for each of the three columns. Re-run the previous queries and compare the results.
- **_Solution_** for **_Task 4_**, should be like this: 
```SQL
exercise4.txt -- Create a multi-column index covering the client_id, recipient_id and composition_id columns.
CREATE INDEX multi_column_index ON orders (client_id, recipient_id, composition_id);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE client_id = 'msowins' AND recipient_id = 1 AND composition_id = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE client_id = 'msowins' OR recipient_id = 1 OR composition_id = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE composition_id = 'buk1';
DROP INDEX multi_column_index;
CREATE INDEX composition_index ON orders (composition_id);
CREATE INDEX recipient_index ON orders (recipient_id);
CREATE INDEX client_index ON orders (client_id);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE client_id = 'msowins' AND recipient_id = 1 AND composition_id = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE client_id = 'msowins' OR recipient_id = 1 OR composition_id = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE composition_id = 'buk1';
```
