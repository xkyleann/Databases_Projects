# DATABASES P1
- Project topic is **_Indexing_** 
- Documantation can be find at --> [Lecture 1](https://github.com/Kyleann/AGH_Databeses_2/files/11012274/01-recap-sql-postgres-latest.pdf)

## Useful SQL Commands 
  - The **ANALYZE** command collects statistics of value distribution in table columns and stores them in the pg_statistic system catalog. The planner will only be able to determine an optimal execution plan if the ANALYZE command was executed for a given table and its columns significant for the query.
  - The **EXPLAIN** command displays the query execution plan. Using the **_VERBOSE_** option will show more details. The **_ANALYZE_** option automatically executes **_ANALYZE_** and the query itself, letting EXPLAIN display not only the plan but also the actual execution results.
  
## Projects 
- Exercise for Indexing with SQL. 
- Includes 8 exercises including answers.
##### Task 1: Hash-Based Indexes 
- Execute a query that displays all orders for the buk1 composition. Check the execution plan and take note of the execution times.
- Add a hash-based index that can accelerate the aforementioned query to the orders table. Take note of the plan and execution plan.
- **_Solution_** for **_Task 1_**, should be like this: 
```SQL
exercise1.txt -- Execute a query that displays all orders for the buk1 composition. Check the execution plan and take note of the execution times.
SELECT * FROM all_orders WHERE compositions_no = 'buk1'; -- compositions_no also refers composition_id
CREATE INDEX compositions_in ON orders USING hash (compositions_no);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT DESCRIPTION * FROM all_orders WHERE composition_no = 'buk1';
```
##### Task 2: B-tree indexes
- Delete the index created in the previous exercise and create a similar one, but using B-trees. Repeat the previous query and take a note of the results.
- Execute a query displaying orders of all compositions with IDs beginning with letters appearing before the letter 'c' in the alphabet. Is the index in use?
- Run another query, displaying the remaining orders (beginning with 'c' and so on). Is the index in use now?
- Try forcing the use of indexes by switching the enable_seqscan parameter:
```SQL
SET ENABLE_SEQSCAN TO OFF;
```
- This will "encourage" PostgreSQL to use indexes â€“ this kind of optimisation may be useful when using mass storage with short seek times, such as SSD drives. Repeat the two queries and compare their execution plans and times.
- - **_Solution_** for **_Task 2_**, should be like this: 
```SQL
exercise2.txt -- Delete the index created in the previous exercise and create a similar one, but using B-trees. Repeat the previous query and take a note of the results.
CREATE INDEX compositions_in ON all_orders (compositions_no);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT DESCRIPTION * FROM WHERE compositions_no = 'buk1';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM WHERE compositions_no < 'c' -- Execute a query displaying orders of all compositions with IDs beginning with letters appearing before the letter 'c' in the alphabet. Is the index in use?
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT compositions_no from all_orders where compositions_no ='c' AND paid='f';
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM all_orders WHERE compositions_no ~ '^c'; -- can be removed 
DROP INDEX compositions_in;
```
